## Abstract
Self-awareness in a computing system is achieved by implementing a model-based learning, reasoning, and acting loop (LRA-M loop). Similar to the feedback loops for self-adaptive software, we argue that the LRA-M loop should be addressed during the architectural design of self-aware computing systems. This allows engineers to explicitly decide and reason about the system’s self-awareness capabilities. This chapter, therefore, introduces the relevant architectural concepts to address and make the LRA-M loop visible in the architectural design. Based on these concepts, we discuss how context-awareness, self-awareness, and meta-self-awareness become manifest in an architecture. Finally, we relate the presented architectural concepts to the definition and framework for self-aware computing systems introduced in the previous chapters.
