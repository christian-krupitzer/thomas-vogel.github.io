## Abstract
A popular guideline to manage todayâ€™s complex and heterogeneous IT systems is the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which provides a catalogue of best practices for IT Service Management (ITSM). However, state-of-the-art implementations of ITIL rely on a set of XML-based standards. To ease manageability and effectively exploit a Configuration Management System (CMS), which is the integral part of ITSM, we suggest in this paper a model-driven CMS by applying Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). Metamodel based models improve the manageability by providing a suitable abstraction, which enables direct user interaction as well as the application of MDE techniques such as model transformations. Furthermore, vital elements of a model-driven CMS are runtime models, which capture the managed system. In addition, this paper reports on a first prototype implementation of a model-driven CMS that exploits runtime models, their automatic maintenance, model-based analysis on these runtime models, and automatic adaptation of the managed system by facilitating changes on runtime models.
