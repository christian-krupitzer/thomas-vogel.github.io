## Abstract
In this chapter, we review the state of the art in self-aware computing systems with a particular focus on software architectures. Therefore, we compare existing approaches targeting computing systems with similar characteristics as self-aware systems to the architectural concepts for single and collective self-aware systems discussed in the previous chapters. These approaches are particularly reference architectures and architectural frameworks and languages. Based on this comparison, we discuss open challenges for architectures of self-aware computing systems.
