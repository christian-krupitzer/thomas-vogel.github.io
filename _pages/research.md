My research focuses on developing methodologies and tools that are either
based on model-driven engineering principles for software quality assurance and software adaptation
or on landscape analysis for search-based software engineering.

# Projects

## FLASH
Fitness landscape analysis to improve search heuristics in search-based software engineering.

## Safe.Spec
Quality assurance of behavioral software requirements.

## EUREMA
A domain-specific modeling language to specify and execute feedback loops in self-adaptive software.

## MORISIA
Runtime models for self-adaptive software.

## mRUBiS
An exemplar for model-based architectural self-healing and self-optimization. See [paper](publications/2018-SEAMSa) and [artifact at GitHub](https://github.com/thomas-vogel/mRUBiS){:target="_blank"}.
