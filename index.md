 __Apr 2018__ --- My dissertation entitled [_Model-Driven Engineering of Self-Adaptive Software_](publications/phd) and graded _summa cum laude_ is now available online.
* __Feb 2019__ --- Our project [_Fitness Landscape Analysis to improve Search Heuristics (FLASH)_](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/se/research/ongoingprojects/flash/flash){:target="_blank"} funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) has started. 
* __Jan 2019__ --- Joel Greenyer, Malte Lochau, and I run the [_GI-Dagstuhl Seminar on Explainable Software for Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://thomas-vogel.github.io/ES4CPS/){:target="_blank"} at Schloss Dagstuhl. At the seminar I gave a talk on _Explainable Quality Assurance of Behavioral Requirements_ ([Abstract](https://thomas-vogel.github.io/ES4CPS/abstracts/Vogel.pdf){:target="_blank"}).
* __Jan 2019__ --- I joined the PC of the Posters, Tools, and Demos Track of the [_13th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2019)_](https://ecsa2019.univ-lille.fr/tracks/posters-tools-demos){:target="_blank"} and the PC of the joint Posters and Demos Track of the [_13th IEEE International Conference on Self-Adaptive and Self-Organizing Systems (SASO 2019)_](http://saso2019.cs.umu.se/calls/call-for-posters-and-demos/){:target="_blank"} and the [_16th IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing (ICAC 2019)_](http://icac2019.cs.umu.se/calls/call-for-posters-and-demos/){:target="_blank"}. Consider submitting posters, tools, and demos.
* __Nov 2018__ --- As a winner of the Facebook Testing and Verification (FaceTAV) Research Award, I gave an invited talk about _Self-Adaptive Search for Sapienz_ at the FaceTAV Challenge Workshop and attended the FaceTAV Symposium at the Facebook offices in London.
* __Nov 2018__ --- I joined in the PC of the Search-Based Software Engineering Track of the [_Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2019)_](https://gecco-2019.sigevo.org/){:target="_blank"}. Consider submitting high-quality papers.
* __Oct 2018__ --- Very happy to receive a [_Facebook Testing and Verification Research Award_](https://research.fb.com/announcing-the-winners-of-the-facebook-testing-and-verification-research-awards/){:target="_blank"}. The award comes along with funding for my research project _Self-Adaptive Search for Sapienz_.
